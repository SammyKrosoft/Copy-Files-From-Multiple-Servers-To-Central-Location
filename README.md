# Copy-Files-From-Multiple-Servers-To-Central-Location
Just a sample script about how we can achieve copying files from multiple sources to one central source

# Development in progress...
- Working on Graphical User Interface (WPF) on file.ps1  appended with "GUI"
- Command line script version : for now we have to specify source and target locations manually, through several variables (Exchange install directory location, path to log files we need to collect,...)
